# Deployment

In this directory exists `vaultingkube-deployment.yaml`.

On lines 24-33 are configurable environment variables that will need to be set on a per deployment basis.  After these are updated for your environment run `kubectl apply -f vaultingkube-deployment.yaml`.  See the main README.md for documentation on environment variables.
